## FEATURES

- Chatbot: A conversational bot built using RASA or a similar framework to talk and console users.
It acts as a support system for users to express their emotions and get guidance.

- Daily Log Tracker: A journaling feature where users can record their daily thoughts, emotions, and activities.
AI analyzes the logs to recommend personalized coping mechanisms or suggestions.

- Data Security with Web3: The data will be stored using Web3 technologies (IPFS) for decentralized and secure storage.
Before sending data to the blockchain, it will be encrypted to ensure privacy.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) could be implemented to further enhance security.

- Personal Analytics: A dashboard for users to view their progress over time, analyze patterns in their mood or behavior, and track improvements.
It provides insights based on the user's logged data.

- Mood Tracker: A feature to track emotional states over time, visualized through charts or graphs.
It helps users identify triggers and manage mental health effectively.

## USP

- Data privacy with Web3 and encryption.
- AI-driven coping suggestions tailored to user needs.
- Advanced analytics for tracking mental health progress.
- User-friendly UI with a modern design (using Tailwind CSS).

## APPROACH

1. Requirements and Technology Setup
Frontend: React (with hooks for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling).
Backend: Node.js with Express.
Database: MongoDB for user data, Web3 (e.g., IPFS or a blockchain-based database) for journal storage.
Authentication: JWT for secure access.
AI Integration: Use a pre-trained AI/ML model for personalized coping suggestions (hosted via a Python Flask API or Node.js library).

3. Architecture and Workflow Design
Frontend:
Develop components for:
Chatbot UI for users to interact and get coping suggestions.
Daily Log Interface for journal entry.
Analytics Dashboard for progress tracking and mood analysis.
Mood Tracker for quick emotion logging.
Set up routes using react-router-dom:
/chat, /journal, /dashboard, /tracker, /login, /signup.

3. Implementing Features

    A. Authentication System
    Use bcrypt to hash user passwords.
    Use JWT for session management:
    Include the token in Authorization headers for secure API calls.
    Create login and signup endpoints in the backend.
    
    B. Journal Entry with Web3 Storage
    Use Web3 library (e.g., ipfs-http-client) to:
    Encrypt journal entries (e.g., AES encryption in JavaScript).
    Upload encrypted entries to IPFS or another Web3 storage.
    Store returned hash in MongoDB as metadata (along with timestamp, user ID).
    
    Frontend flow:
    Users input journals in the UI.
    Data is sent to the backend for encryption and storage in Web3.

    C. Chatbot for Coping Suggestions
      1. Personalization:
      AI Model Tuning: Use NLP models like GPT or Rasa, trained specifically for mental health-related conversations.
      User Profiles: Tailor suggestions based on user preferences, history, and mood trends (e.g., if a user prefers meditation, suggest guided meditations).
      Language Support: Add multilingual capabilities to cater to diverse audiences.
    
      2. Interactivity:
      Voice Input/Output: Allow users to talk to the chatbot instead of typing, making it more natural and accessible.
      Emotion Recognition: Integrate sentiment analysis on user inputs to detect distress levels and respond empathetically.
      Gamified Chat: Introduce engaging elements like daily challenges, motivational quotes, or calming GIFs after conversations.
    
      3. Community Interaction:
      Anonymous Sharing: Let users anonymously share positive experiences or solutions they've found effective (curated by moderators).
      Safe Space Option: Include features where users can have non-judgmental, supportive discussions (moderated).
    
      4. Practical Coping Tools:
      Provide actionable tools during conversations:
      Breathing exercises (with animations).
      Quick access to calming sounds or playlists (via Spotify API).
      Prompts for journaling or gratitude exercises.
    
    D. Mood Tracker
    Develop a UI with options for users to log their mood (e.g., emojis or a scale).
    Store mood logs in MongoDB with timestamp and user ID.
    Provide visualizations (e.g., charts) using a library like Chart.js.
    
    E. Personal Analytics Dashboard
    Backend flow:
    Aggregate data from mood tracker logs and journal metadata.
    Generate insights (e.g., mood trends, word sentiment analysis from journals).
    
    F. Data Security
    Encrypt sensitive data (like journals) before storing it in Web3:
    Use AES for encryption in the backend.
    Store only encrypted data in Web3 storage.
    Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
    Limit access to journal data:
    Generate a decryption key that only the user can use to access their journal.
